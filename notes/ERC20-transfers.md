Ah, `.call{value: value}("")` is used for sending ETH (native cryptocurrency), not for ERC20 tokens. Here's the difference:

For ETH transfers:

```solidity
// Sending ETH
address payable recipient = payable(msg.sender);
(bool success,) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
require(success, "Transfer failed");
```

For ERC20 tokens:

```solidity
// Sending tokens
IERC20 token = IERC20(tokenAddress);
token.transfer(recipient, amount);
// or for more safety
token.safeTransfer(recipient, amount);  // using SafeERC20
```

The reason is:

- `.call{value}` - interacts with native ETH
- `.transfer()` - is a function defined in ERC20 token standard for moving tokens

Example in vesting context:

```solidity
// WRONG - This would try to send ETH
(bool success,) = beneficiary.call{value: amount}("");

// CORRECT - This sends ERC20 tokens
token.transfer(beneficiary, amount);
// or safer version
token.safeTransfer(beneficiary, amount);
```

Want me to explain more about the differences between ETH and token transfers?
