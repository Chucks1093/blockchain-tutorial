I'll help you implement this function to handle contract addresses and set up PM2 for checkupkeeps. Here's a complete implementation:

Now let's set up the Prisma schema for your database:

Let's implement the function to check upkeeps on the contracts:

Finally, let's set up the PM2 configuration to run your checkupkeeps function:

Now, let's create a script to launch your application using PM2:

Here's how all these components work together:

1. **Express Handler** (`upkeep-handler.ts`): Provides HTTP endpoints to register and manage contract addresses.

2. **Prisma Schema** (`schema.prisma`): Defines your database model for storing contract addresses and their check status.

3. **Upkeep Service** (`upkeep-service.ts`): Contains the logic to check contracts using ethers.js, which can be run directly or scheduled.

4. **PM2 Configuration** (`ecosystem.config.json`): Schedules the upkeep checks every 10 minutes and manages your API server.

5. **Start Script** (`start.sh`): Builds and starts your application with PM2.

To implement this solution:

1. Install required dependencies:

```bash
npm install @prisma/client ethers zod dotenv
npm install -D prisma typescript @types/express
```

2. Initialize Prisma with your PostgreSQL connection:

```bash
npx prisma init
```

3. Update the `.env` file with your database and blockchain connections:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydb"
MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://ethereum-mainnet.provider.com"
GOERLI_RPC_URL="https://ethereum-goerli.provider.com"
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL="https://ethereum-sepolia.provider.com"
```

4. Generate Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

5. Install PM2 globally:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
```

6. Make the start script executable:

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
```

7. Run the start script:

```bash
./start.sh
```

This implementation provides a robust system for monitoring blockchain contracts with regular upkeep checks that are stored in your PostgreSQL database.
