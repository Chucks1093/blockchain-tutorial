# I am leaving this project for now to continue in the next two weeks

- Trying to run the executer function in automation.service in automation.script using bull cron on pm2. we have created a docker container for redis and ioredis the next step is to integrate them to start the cron job running

- After that we moved formward with testing the events for the Automation triggered and add script to record to the database if the `checkAndExecute` function was successfull or preform upkeep was initialized.

- Once this is complete we move forward with testing and integrating into the automator project and then move back to the reason we created this project in the first place which was the tokenVesting contract project
