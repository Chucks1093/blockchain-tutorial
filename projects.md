These detailed steps and additional features should provide you with a comprehensive roadmap for building and expanding each project. Remember to thoroughly test your contracts, handle edge cases, and consider security best practices throughout the development process.

As you progress through these projects, you'll gain hands-on experience with various aspects of Solidity programming, smart contract development, and Ethereum dapp building. Feel free to customize and extend these projects based on your specific requirements and learning goals.
Project Development Tips:

-   Start with a clear, simple scope
-   Break down the project into small, manageable components
-   Write tests for each function
-   Use Foundry's testing framework (forge test)
-   Deploy on local networks first
-   Gradually add complexity
